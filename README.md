2.	Opening different applications from the CLI.
3.	Shutting Down/Restarting host machine.
4.	Providing a calculator to do mathematical stuff.
5.	And counting…..

Any contributions will be considered helpful.

It will be using WinAPI and C++ to implement different functionalities.

### HOW TO BUILD : 
1.  Download the zip file or clone the project.
2.  Then run it in an IDE like Visual Studio or Code Blocks (basically anything that provides/supports a C++ compiler).

    - calculate and an expression seperated by space : To evaluate it.
    - notepad : To open a notepad in current directory.
